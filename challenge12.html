        <p>Nigerian cuisine often involves specific cooking methods and ingredients that bring out the best in each dish. Here are some tips and techniques to help you master these flavors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grinding Spices: Many Nigerian recipes call for ground spices. A small mortar and pestle or a spice grinder can help achieve the freshest flavors.</li>
            <li>Cooking with Palm Oil: This red oil adds a unique flavor and richness to many soups and stews. Use moderate heat to avoid burning, as palm oil has a lower smoke point than other oils.</li>
            <li>Preparing Soups: Nigerian soups are often thick and hearty. Make sure to cook the base (whether it's tomatoes or other ingredients) thoroughly for a deep flavor profile.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="glossary">Glossary of Ingredients</h2>

            <li>Ogbono Seeds: Ground ogbono seeds are used to create a unique, viscous texture in soups.</li>
            <li>Palm Oil: A red, richly flavored oil derived from the fruit of oil palms, widely used in Nigerian stews and soups.</li>
            <li>Ugu (Pumpkin Leaves): Commonly used in soups, these leaves add a fresh, earthy taste and are packed with nutrients.</li>
